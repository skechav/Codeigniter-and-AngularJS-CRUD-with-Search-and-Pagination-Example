As described above this is a short basic example code showing how to create a very simple crud, search and pagination module and easily use in your Codeigniter 3 project using Angular.js for the front-end part of the application.

This code has been forked from Savanihd repository - cause I found it interesting for my angular.js noob skills -  in order to extend it so it fits my needs, mainly for testing and learning purposes only. It is NOT something to use in production envriroments without the proper tweaks and improvements. 

In this example we are outputing json_encoded data from codeigniters controllers calling the respective codeigniter model. In case you need to have a "fully" RESTful server implementation for you CodeIgniter core app using just one library, one config file and one controller you need to install the  [codeigniter-restserver](https://github.com/chriskacerguis/codeigniter-restserver) library from chriskacerguis. 

In the code you will also see a basic codeigniters' routes set up, how to manage Angular.js route and controller, build the app Angular.js code, write your template files for your App and more....

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.
